# Business Plan
## Edgar Aroutiounian 

*Use left/right arrow to go back/forth through slideshow or left/right swipe on mobile*

## Problem

1. No truly unique, exciting way to tell stories, communicate.
2. No way for the masses to tell data intensive, 
   interactive stories in an secure way.
3. No non-toxic large communities, reddit/twitter are quite toxic.
4. Expert opinion has become irrelevant or disliked, anti-intellectualism Trump age.
5. Truly telling a story can't be captured in a browser tab.
6. NYT level of interactive, data intensive story telling currently limited
   to highly technical people.
	  </script>

## Solution

1. A dedicated desktop app for Windows, Linux & OS X
   with security built-in and activated by default,
   no wasting time of the user.
2. Half of created communitites will be actively moderated which ensures 
   a minimum set of quality communities.
3. Public intellectuals and experts get a privileged spot for their views, 
   big names, think Katie Couric on Yahoo. 
4. Provide a rich, interactive creation 
   experience for content creators. (Medium white page is boring)
5. Create an in-app marketplace of 'effects', imagine developers
   creating smoke effects, lighting effects that end users can drag and drop
   into their stories, experiences.

## Key Metrics

Of course key metrics for us would be:

1. Rate of user acquisition, need rapid growth
2. Rate of content creation, need reason for people to come
3. Rate of inflows, aka special link that people use to open our app, 
   how did they come to our app?
4. In-app app store health with its own set of metrics.

## Unique Value Proposition

Because we have a dedicated desktop app, 
we have full control of the user experience, that is 
we have the full power of the end user's computer. This allows
us to use much more technically taxing technologies on the computer for
better user experience, website can never compete with that.

*AKA: Imagine a Virtual Reality Story from Syria.*

In addition, as cyber-security becomes more of an important issue, 
ways of communicating securely become more important 
(see the proliferation of messaging apps with encryption, 
Whatsapp, telegram, Signal, Viper, etc)

## Customer Segments

Our 'customer' is the entire world population. As an initial start we can
canniblize twitter, a 500 million user corpse but plans are to take reddit
and medium's base as well. This is a viral network effect technology, 
expect rapid growth.

## Cost Structure

Its software: Costs are basically programmer salary 
and eventual infrastructure costs, 
relativity cheap given cloud providers.

	  <script type="text/template">
## Revenue Streams
Too early to talk about revenue streams since growth is what matters.
That said, obvious source of revenues are in app ads and per month 
subscription payment for the security features. $5 easily payable a month
for the security premium.

In app marketplace can also take a percentage for paid features.

## Timeline for product

This is a highly ambitious and technically challenging project. 
User experience must be flawless. My estimate is myself, a junior developer
and one more highly skilled cross domain programmer work about eight hours
a day for about two months for the first cradle to grave POC.
