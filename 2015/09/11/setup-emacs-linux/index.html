    <p><strong>Note</strong> This series initially appeared on my previous blog and I’m just porting it over to here with small stylistic changes.</p>
<p>This post will share some configurations I did to setup emacs for linux kernel coding. Some minor context, the following emacs setup came as a result of my Operating Systems class fall 2014. Note, a lot of what I will go over is due to the great tutorials and walkthroughs made by the emacs community, especially by Tuhdo’s <a href="http://tuhdo.github.io/c-ide.html">great post</a>.</p>
<h1 id="the-tools">The tools</h1>
<p>Since our homeworks were assigned on a Debian VM, the natural beginning tool was emacs + tramp. One thing early annoyance was tramp constantly asking for passwords, so I put this in my init.el</p>
<pre class="emacs-lisp"><code>(setq password-cache-expiry nil)</code></pre>
<p>and that took care of that. The next was CEDET/semantic, this one took quite a bit of effort…</p>
<h1 id="semantic">Semantic</h1>
<p>Emacs comes with CEDET, a suite of mainly C, C-like languages utlities, the most useful of which is semantic. Semantic provides autocomplete that makes emacs provide IDE like code completion. Initially, I tried to make the builtin CEDET work, but no matter all my efforts, it just wouldn’t work right. So I proceeded to get the source for CEDET and installed it, was really easy. After getting CEDET install, I added this to my init.el.</p>
<pre class="emacs-lisp"><code>(load-file &quot;~/.emacs.d/cedet/cedet-devel-load.elc&quot;)
(require 'semantic/senator)
(require 'semantic/ia)
(require 'semantic/analyze/refs)
(require 'semantic/analyze/complete)
(require 'semantic/bovine/gcc)
(require 'semantic/mru-bookmark)
(require 'semantic)
(global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode 1)
(global-semantic-decoration-mode 1)
(global-semantic-idle-summary-mode 1)
(global-semantic-stickyfunc-mode 1)
(global-semantic-idle-local-symbol-highlight-mode 1)
(global-semantic-mru-bookmark-mode 1)
(global-semanticdb-minor-mode 1)
(global-cedet-m3-minor-mode 1)
(semanticdb-enable-gnu-global-databases 'c-mode t)
(global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode t)</code></pre>
<p>I also used <code>company-mode</code> as the front end for semantic, you’ll need to edit the variable <code>company-backends</code> and have the list include the symbol <code>company-semantic</code>. Next came the biggest issue, semantic was having problems finding the #include because Linux’s source code headers are of the form <code>#include &lt;header.h&gt;</code>, which makes semantic search in system headers and that is just all wrong for when you’re coding Linux. The original solution I found was to use EDE, but EDE is just too damn confusing to work plus and doesn’t seem to give much bang for buck. Instead I went with a kludge, but like all good kludges, it works. I defined this function:</p>
<pre class="emacs-lisp"><code>(defun os-s ()
  &quot;Only way to get semantic to play nicely with desired files,
   very strange, *remember* to add the trailing slash for directories.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (setq company-c-headers-path-system '(&quot;/ssh:os:/home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel/arch/arm/i
                                        &quot;/ssh:os:/home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel/include/&quot;)
  (setq company-c-headers-path-user '(&quot; /ssh:os:/home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel/include/&quot;))
  (semantic-reset-system-include)
  (setq semantic-dependency-include-path '(&quot;/ssh:os:/home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel/kernel/
  (semantic-add-system-include &quot;/ssh:os:/home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel/arch/arm/include/&quot;)
  (semantic-add-system-include &quot;/ssh:os:/home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel/include/&quot;)
  (setq-default semantic-symref-tool 'global)
  ;;For tramp mainly 
  ;; (setq default-directory &quot;/ssh:os:&quot;)
  ;;Doesn't seem to work since this is a function defined in the shell? 
  ;; (local-set-key (kbd &quot;M-z&quot;) '(lambda () 
  ;;                            (shell-command &quot;b&quot;)))
  (mapc (lambda (item)
          (add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path item))
        '(&quot;/home/w4118/utils/android-sdk-linux/tools&quot;
          &quot;/home/w4118/utils/android-sdk-linux/platform-tools&quot;
          &quot;/home/w4118/utils/arm-eabi-4.6/bin&quot;
          &quot;/home/w4118/utils/bin&quot;
          &quot;/home/w4118/utils/arm-2013.11/bin&quot;))
  (setq compile-command (concat
                         &quot;make -j8 ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/w4118/utils/arm-eabi-4.6/bin/
                         &quot; -C /home/w4118/hmwk6-prog/flo-kernel&quot;)))</code></pre>
<p>Basically I wipe away the values that might be defined for semantic and impose the ones of interest to me. I call this function via another function that I use as a helper, it mainly opens a file in the VM and calls <code>os-s</code>. You’ll notice some commented out code, the first was some time wasted with tramp and the second was trying to use an alias in the remote shell, hint: it didn’t work.</p>
<p>That’s it for this post. <a href="http://hyegar.com/blog/2015/09/11/emacs-for-linux-coding-part-ii/">Part Two</a> relates to gnu global/helm.</p>
