    </header>
    <p>This is part two from the my first <a href="./2017-03-12-my-practical-armenia">post</a>.</p>
<h1 id="financials">Financials</h1>
<p>Once in Armenia youâ€™ll need to get a feel for the prices and whatnot. You should need to spend at most 5,000 drams a day, thatâ€™s like $11.</p>
<pre><code>PRO-TIP: $11 is a slice of pizza and beverage in San Francisco. </code></pre>
<p>I can easily survive on just about 1,500 drams a day and I eat much better than I ever did in America.</p>
<p>Rent should be about at most $300 a month, which I think is quite fancy and in the city. I spent $250 a month last year during my first stay in Armenia in a very close to the center, Kentron, part of Yerevan, keep in mind that outside Kentron the prices are much cheaper.</p>
<p>You should also make an Armenian bank account, the Armenian financial system is surprisingly strong, although I suspect at the cost of massive government debt, and I like using AmeriaBank as they have a pretty good online banking experience and wire transfers from my American Chase account only take three days. The local branches are super-efficient and everyone knows Russian, probably English too.</p>
<h1 id="more-cultural-observations">More cultural observations</h1>
<p>If you donâ€™t know Armenian, then be prepared to answer why you donâ€™t know Armenian. Everyone will ask why you donâ€™t know.</p>
<pre><code>PRO-TIP: Its a legitmate question, why don't you know Armenian?</code></pre>
<p>Sign up for an Armenian class ASAP, I really recommend ArmScoopâ€™s class <code>Armenian as a foreign language</code> as its intensive, fast paced and immersive.</p>
<pre><code>ANECDOTE: I was outside my Yerevan apartment last
year and an older man started asking me something in Armenian. I
replied in Russian that I didn't know Armenian yet, he then asks
'okay, well where is the local police station?'. I told him I didn't
know that either, to which he said: &quot;You don't know Armenian, you
don't know where the police station is, what are you good for
anyway?&quot;...to which I told him I'm an American Armenian and I moved
here. To that he replied, 'Ah well, good job son, you're a good
person'.ðŸ˜„</code></pre>
<h2 id="you-are-in-a-different-society">You are in a different society</h2>
<p>Society in general is quite a bit more conservative, but that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t walk around with a Mohawk (at least in Yerevan you could)</p>
<p>that saidâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you canâ€™t get shit faced drunk and pee on the station as if it was NYCâ€™s union square at 2am because the metro is closed after 11pm, a real bummer, and someone would probably beat you up.</p></li>
<li><p>You canâ€™t walk around yelling profanity or just about anything you want, people will shush you.</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>ANECDOTE: I was walking to the metro station on a street 
filled with shopkeepers. In front of me was a mother 
with a child in her arm, kid was on verge of tears but
the mother's soothing kept him just on the 
precipice. As we walked down the street literally every 
shopkeeper pitched in to help keep the kid calm. That would 
never happen in NYC America or SF America, maybe in the
American Southern states.</code></pre>
<pre><code>PRO-TIP: This is a preferable society.</code></pre>
<p>You <em>really</em> feel more connected to other humans and especially as a Diasporan coming to Armenia proper as youâ€™ve made a conscious effort to change the course of this society.</p>
<pre><code>PRO-TIP: You will feel very good when you see the 
fruits of your labor.</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-only-culture-shock">The only culture shock</h2>
<p>Maybe because I grew up in a Russian environment, that is Russian at home and being a Brooklyn kid, I didnâ€™t have all that much culture shock other than gender relations here which are quite a bit more conservative than San Francisco, for example, but then again which society isnâ€™t? My biggest culture mismatch mostly related to dating as itâ€™s pretty hard to get women to physically meet you and sex before marriage is mostly a myth, almost a double tragedy is that the girls here are much prettier than in America and dress on average much better.</p>
<pre><code>PRO-TIP: Your intuitions will be busted, need to adjust.</code></pre>
<h2 id="effort">Effort</h2>
<p>So not everything is 100% ideal in Armenia, but for the things Iâ€™ve lost thereâ€™s a lot that I gained.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Living costs are way cheaper, if youâ€™re a programmer you can still work Western wages but remotely.</p></li>
<li><p>The food is way better, no need waste $150 going to Whole Foods each time.</p></li>
<li><p>The women want families and husbands, culture emphasizes family.</p></li>
<li><p>The country is small, talented &amp; technically competent people can make changes that rapidly affect many people, you can see the results quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>You are living in our ancestral homeland of 3,000 years and are working directly to make it stronger, richer, happier.ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡²</p></li>
